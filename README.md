# elisa-3 cluster pc-side
This is a terminal application exchanging data with the robots from the computer through the radio base-station. The demo uses the information gathered from the robots (in cluster status) and update their RGB LEDs accordingly with a random color at fixed intervals. The demo was tested with 37 robots but more robots can be added to the list.<br/>
The project depends on the [Elisa-3 remote library](http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/Elisa-3#Elisa-3_library).<br/>
